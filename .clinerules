# Project-Specific Rules for BoopClaude

## Deployment Testing - Visual Change Indicator

When pushing an update to the repository and we are testing the website, **randomly change the background color** so the user can visually confirm when changes are live.

### Implementation:
- Before committing/pushing changes during active website testing, modify a visible CSS property (e.g., background color) to a random value
- This provides immediate visual feedback that the deployment has gone through
- Common locations to modify:
  - `client/src/index.css` - main body/app background
  - `client/src/App.tsx` - inline styles or Tailwind classes
- Use subtle but noticeable color variations (e.g., slight tint changes, pastel colors)

### Example random colors to cycle through:
- `#fef3c7` (warm cream)
- `#e0f2fe` (light blue)
- `#fce7f3` (light pink)
- `#ecfccb` (light lime)
- `#f3e8ff` (light purple)
- `#ccfbf1` (light teal)

### When to revert:
- Once testing is complete and the deployment is verified, revert the background color to the original design value before final commit
